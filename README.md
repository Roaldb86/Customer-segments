# Customer-segments Udacity DataScientist project

### Motivation
This project was part of Udacitys Nanodegree for data scientist program.
The task was to identify customer segments from an actual dataset provided from a German mailorder company.
The data itself could not be disclosed.

### Summary
I used PCA and Kmeans clustering to identify 5 unique customer segments from tha data.
The most important features for identifying new customers for the mail order company was people with relativly low income 
and low social status
